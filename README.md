A web app to book appointments in different banks in Afghanistan
This webpage is build as an admission challenge for Code University of Applied Science. I was asked to identify a problem and provide a solution through technology.
Here is a full explanation of the problem and solution :
Problem:
I would like to express a real problem that I faced and I came up with a solution that can be implemented through technology. The problem is about money transferring which was extremely difficult in Afghanistan after the collapse of the republic government. In 2022, when the Afghanistan republic government collapsed in the hands of the Taliban, people rushed to banks and wanted to withdraw their money. Unemployment and poverty dominated the country and made the people dependable on their relatives who lived abroad. 
When my aunt sent 300$ through a foreign remittance, I received it in one week. I went at 4 A.M in front of the bank and waited till 4 P.M every day for one week. All the people suffered from the same problem. People flocked before the banks’ doors and wanted to receive their money which was sent through Money Gram or Western Union. It was not so simple, they would go at 4 or 3 even at 2 A.M to take place and put their names on the list, since the list was limited and only the first 200 or in some small branches less than 200 people could obtain their money. Then they would wait till 8 for the employees to start working. After that, it was about waiting for their names to be read from the list. The last name’s turn in the list was at 3 or 3:30 P.M. However, I came up with a solution that could be implemented by a website. 
Solution: 
My solution for the problem was that it could develop a website where all the banks would be registered to that site and people could receive turn online. If we have n branches of the banks and every branch have an m counter, supposing that every transfer takes 20 minutes to be operated, based on these criteria, the system gave the turn to the people with the exact date which includes the day and time. This approach could facilitate the operation of the remittance and prevented wasting the time, not making the banks busy and crowded. 
Users could only take one turn and would choose the nearest branch of the bank. Then according to the date and time which were specified in the turn, he or she would refer to the bank to receive his/her money.
How to see the final result ? 
Simply click on the link https://bank-appointment.vercel.app/
Or open the command prompt, go the banking appointment directory and type : npm run dev
if it doesn't work, run npm install first.
Make sure that you have already installed the nodeJs in your computer.
 Thank you for taking the time and putting the effort to consider my application. My acceptance at the Code University of Applied Science will make dreams which is to work with big companies such as Meta and Google, come true.
